## About

I am an MBA student at University Canada West (anticipated June 2026) who has more than a decade of experience in clinical operations and healthcare.
My professional environment was developed in the organised and controlled settings where there is a need to be compliant, organized and accountable. During my work experience in dentistry and clinic management, I acquired high efficiency of operations, leadership potential, and orientation to quality criteria.

My MBA has created an interest in me in business analytics and business performance measurement. Despite most of my experience being in the area of healthcare operations, I am now developing analytical knowledge to learn how data can be used to inform strategic and operational decisions.

I am especially inclined towards designed 
environments, such as non-business or controlled, where governance and explicit systems make their way through performance.
